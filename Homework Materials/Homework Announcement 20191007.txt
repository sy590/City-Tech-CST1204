
Hi everyone,


The latest class slides, sample SQL (Sample SQL 03 WHERE and ORDER BY), homework templates, and prev homework answer have all been uploaded to the Blackboard Content section.


Homework 1: SQLPlus access


Some of you have already completed this task. For those who haven't, please make sure you complete this ASAP. Please remote desktop into CSTTS_LAB (not CSTTS), open up Database folder on your desktop, login into SQLPlus using your emplID@orcl (password tester), and run the following simple SQL:


CREATE TABLE test_tbl (id int);

INSERT INTO test_tbl VALUES (1);

SELECT * from test_tbl;

DROP TABLE test_tbl;


Please take a screenshot of the statement execution results and send the screenshot to me. You should be able to complete all four statements in one screen.


Make sure you try it a couple of times at different times. If, after two or three tries, you still cannot access CSTTS_Lab, please let me know.
