
Hi everyone,


Class slides for yesterday's session, together with sample SQLs we used in class, have been uploaded to the Blackboard Content section.


There are two homework assignments this week:


Homework 1: SQLPlus access

Tonight after most of you left, Marlon and Md tried once more and were able to login into CSTTS_Lab. We believe there is a limit of how many students may log in at the same time. I will talk to IT technicians on this limit. Meanwhile, please run from G600 at a random time to see:


1. whether you can login into CSTTS_Lab, if you haven't been able to do so,

2. if yes to Q1, whether you can login into SQLPlus using your emplID@orcl (password tester), and 

3. if yes to Q2, whether you can run the following simple SQL:


CREATE TABLE test_tbl (id int);

INSERT INTO test_tbl VALUES (1);

SELECT * from test_tbl;

DROP TABLE test_tbl;


Please take a screenshot of each statement and its result and send the four screenshots to me. 


Make sure you try it a couple of times at different times. If, after two or three tries, you still cannot access CSTTS_Lab, please also let me know too.


Homework 2: Simple UPDATE statement exercises

Chapter 6 exercise questions for Colonial Adventure Tours 


I have uploaded homework template file to Content section. Please use the template file for homework. Make sure you run your SQL before submitting the answers.


Also, for questions regarding TEST ONE, please feel free to send me an email. I will be more than glad to go through the test with you, either in person or on the phone. Our next session will be on Mon 10/07. Please make sure to attend.


Thanks!


Prof.
