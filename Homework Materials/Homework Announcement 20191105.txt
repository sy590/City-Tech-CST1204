The class slides, sample SQL for UNION/INTERSECT/MINUS, and previous homework answers have been posted to Content section. To prepare Wednesday's Test Three, please review previous homework and make sure you have a clear understanding of GROUP BY and HAVING clause. FYI, UNION/INTERSECT/MINUS are not a part of Test Three and will be a part of Test Four.
