Hi everyone,

It comes to my attention that, if you send emails from your cell phone or tablet using a email client, sometimes the email got rejected. Please use City Tech webmail from a computer when you submit your homework. I replied to most of your homework emails that I received. If you have NOT received any reply from me, please submit your previous homework again. I will talk to you in person if I still havem't received anything from you next week.

Also, I always post my class slide and homework requirements to Vity Tech Blackboard's Content section. Please check your Blackboard account for CST1204's Announcement and Content sections if you haven't done so.

Thanks and have a great day!

Prof.
