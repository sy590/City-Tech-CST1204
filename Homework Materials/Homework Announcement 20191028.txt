Hi everyone,

The class slides and answers to our previous homework have been uploaded to Blackbord. There is no homework today. You guys are so fast in learning that I have a hard time keeping up. Keep on the great work!

Mid-term grades have been posted to Blackboard. The grading scheme is as follows:

P=Passing work
BL= Borderline
U=Unsatisfactory
SA=Stopped Attending

Note that this grade will not be recorded in your transcript. For details on where you may be lagging behind and how to improve, please refer to the notice I handed out in person. As always, feel free to come up to me if you have any questions.

Have a good day!

Prof
